Data structures & Associated Python Projects :

• Huffman Tree

	• Huffman Encode and Decode files (War and Peace, Declaration of Independence) 
  
• Stack Array

	• Topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (Recreation of the Unix tsort)
	• Calculate the result of a postfix expression
	• Convert an Infix expression to a Postfix expression
	• Convert a prefix expression to a Postfix expression
  
  
• Queue Array

	• Binary Search Tree
  
  
• Quadratic Hash Table with Horner's rule

	• Concordance Class: Reads "stop words" from an input file and inserts each word as a key into a "stop words hash table." Next, the program reads words from an input text file (such as the dictonary, War and Peace, and The Declaration of Independence) and insert them into the concordance hash table, filtering out punctuation, numbers, and words in the stop words hash table. Writes the concordance entries to an output file.       
  
• Linked Stack

• Doubly-linked Ordered List

• Heap
